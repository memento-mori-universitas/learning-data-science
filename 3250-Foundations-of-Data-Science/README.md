*Book*:
Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_%2B_Data_Structures_%3D_Programs


Three main style of programming languages:

- Imperative - (C)
  - Say step by step how the work needs to be done.
  - You can write very efficient algorithms.

- Object oriented - (Java)
  - Associate a particular code with that data structure.
  - The idea was to convert the language into something humans are familiar with.

- Functional(Lisp)/Declarative(Sql)
    - It much easier to write concurrent programs that run across a cluster.
    - Rather than try to describe the step prescriptively, you write down the end result first.
    - Example, in sql you just write down the results you want and sql figures out how to get that result.


Teacher mentioned that people are shying away from inheritance and going towards composition.

A vector is an order collection of values, they all have to be at the same kind. A vector is a one dimensional  array.

### Data Frame


The cell inside a table is called an observation.


Once column is a special column that holds a function.

Dependent variables
Dependent variables
Independent variable - target
Dependent variables
Dependent variables
Independent variable - target

Dependent variables and one independent variable. The columns are often represented 
A data frame is a specific data set to work in a “table” structure.

Function is a first class object in R. Things you can do is pass a function to a function.

In order to have Jupyter Notebook running I had to install to following irkernal separately.
